## Date: 2026-04-04 — Phase 3 Complete: Rust Independence

### What We Did

1. Built stage1e (bitwise ops: % & | ^ ~ << >>, hex literals, comments, uppercase idents — 63 tests)
2. Built stage1f (token scaling: 4096→16384 slots — mechanical offset change)
3. Wrote asm.cyr (self-hosting assembler: 1128 lines, 43 mnemonics, two-pass, heap-based state)
4. Achieved bootstrap closure: seed→stage1f→asm→stage1f_v2 byte-identical
5. Committed bootstrap binary (bootstrap/asm, 29KB) + bootstrap.sh
6. Archived Rust seed (archive/seed/), deinited upstream submodule (saved 13GB)
7. Cyrius now bootstraps with: `sh bootstrap/bootstrap.sh` — no Rust, no LLVM, no Python

### Key Bugs Found

1. **Duplicate var names create separate stack slots** — declaring `var val` in two branches of the same function creates two separate local slots. The compiler allocates ALL var declarations during parsing regardless of control flow. Fix: split into separate functions (SHEX/SDEC for hex/decimal parsing).
2. **fn-before-var ordering** — stage1f's parser requires all fn definitions before var declarations. Functions can't reference globals. Fix: heap-based state (S pointer + fixed offsets), passed as first param to every function.
3. **Return value 0 vs -1 for try-parse** — DO_ALU2 returned 0 on success (reg,reg handled), but 0 is rax's register code. Caller treated 0 as "unhandled, try immediate." Fix: return -1 for "handled," positive register code for "unhandled."
4. **Input buffer overflow** — stage1d.cyr (73KB) didn't fit in 64KB input buffer. Silent truncation, labels past the cutoff couldn't be found. Fix: increased to 128KB.

### Architecture Decisions

- **Heap state pattern**: All assembler state lives at fixed offsets from a heap base pointer (S). Every function takes S as its first parameter. This mirrors stage1f's own r15+offset pattern but at the high-level language layer.
- **Packed word comparison**: Mnemonics dispatched by packing identifier bytes into a 64-bit value and comparing against precomputed constants — same technique stage1f's lexer uses for keywords.
- **Incremental testing**: Each mnemonic addition verified by byte-exact comparison with seed output. Caught encoding errors immediately rather than at integration time.

### What Worked Well

- Bite-sized approach: V1 (8 mnemonics) → V2a (memory operands) → V2b (everything else). Each step tested independently.
- Byte-exact comparison as gold standard — caught every encoding bug.
- vidya reference material (instruction_encoding, compiler_bootstrapping) prevented several encoding mistakes.

### What We Did

1. Added rust-lang/rust as a shallow submodule at `upstream/`
2. Discovered cargo is a nested submodule — had to `git submodule update --init --depth 1 src/tools/cargo` separately
3. Installed `ninja` (missing build dep)
4. Created `bootstrap.toml` with `profile = "compiler"` and `change-id = "ignore"`
5. Ran `python3 x.py build` — completed in 5:19
6. Result: `rustc 1.96.0-dev` (stage 1)

### Problems Observed

#### 1. Nested Submodules
- rust-lang/rust contains 12+ submodules (cargo, LLVM, gcc, book, reference, etc.)
- Each must be initialized separately or with `--recursive` (which pulls everything)
- Shallow clones help but add complexity
- **Cyrius fix**: single repo. No submodules. The compiler, stdlib, and package manager live in one tree.

#### 2. Python Bootstrap
- The entire build orchestration runs through `x.py`, a Python script
- Python 3 is a hard requirement to build Rust
- `x.py` downloads a pre-built beta `rustc` from Rust CI to compile the real compiler
- "Building from source" is actually "building from source + a binary you downloaded"
- **Cyrius fix**: self-hosting bootstrap. The Cyrius compiler builds the Cyrius compiler. A minimal seed binary is the only external dependency, and that's a one-time cost.

#### 3. External Build Dependencies
- cmake and ninja required for LLVM (unless using CI-built LLVM)
- CI-built LLVM is the default — saves time but means you're trusting a binary from someone else's CI
- **Cyrius fix**: own the entire toolchain. No cmake, no ninja, no external LLVM binaries in the final state.

#### 4. Bootstrap Config Complexity
- `bootstrap.example.toml` is hundreds of lines
- Profiles (`compiler`, `library`, `tools`, etc.) help but the surface area is enormous
- `change-id` tracking for config schema changes is clever but adds friction
- **Cyrius fix**: minimal, opinionated defaults. One build command, no config file for the common case.

### What Worked Well

- CI-built LLVM made the build fast (5 min vs. 60+ min)
- `profile = "compiler"` gave sane defaults
- The stage 1 compiler works immediately
- 16 cores utilized well during compilation
