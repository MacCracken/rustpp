# Cyrius Compiler Benchmarks

Baseline measurements for the v5.6.x optimization arc (v5.6.5–v5.6.11).
Numbers gathered with `CYRIUS_PROF=1` in-compiler timing (monotonic
clock via `clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC)` — syscall 228 on Linux
x86_64, 113 on Linux aarch64) and cross-checked with shell `time`.

Workload: self-host compile (`cc5 < src/main.cyr > /dev/null`). This
is the canonical benchmark because it exercises every phase of the
compiler against its own source — the largest, densest input the
compiler sees in practice. Measured from warm cache (3+ pre-runs
discarded, best-of-5 median reported).

Hardware: Linux 6.18.22-1-lts, x86_64. Precise chip omitted — what
matters is the relative delta between releases on the same machine.

## v5.6.x series — `src/main.cyr` self-host compile

| Release | Median (ms) | Δ vs v5.6.4 | Change |
|---------|-------------|-------------|--------|
| v5.6.4 (pre-O1 baseline) | 409 | — | — |
| v5.6.5 (O1: FNV-1a FINDFN + PROF scaffold) | 402 | −7 ms (−1.7 %) | FNV-1a hash table for fn-name lookup at 0x10C000 (16 KB, 8192 slots, load factor 0.5); open-addressing with linear probing; existing linear-scan fallback preserved for use-alias resolution. |
| v5.6.6 (CYRIUS_PROF cross-platform) | 402 | −7 ms (−1.7 %) | No Linux-path change; adds PE GetTickCount64 + Mach-O libSystem _clock_gettime_nsec_np for cross-platform parity. |
| v5.6.7 (O2 strength reduction: `x * 2^n → shl`) | 405 | −4 ms (−1.0 %) | Compile wall-clock ~flat (peephole check is O(1) at each multiply); **the win is on output-byte count**: cc5 itself shrinks 528,144 → 526,272 B (−1,872 B / −0.35 %) because cyrius hits `imul`-replaceable patterns in its own source. |
| v5.6.8 (O2 flag-reuse + `test rax, rax`) | 355 | −54 ms (−13.2 %) | Biggest single-patch win of the arc so far. Two peepholes combined: (1) `ECONDCMP`'s bare-value path was emitting `push/xor/movca/pop/cmp` (10 B) — replaced with `test rax, rax` (3 B), saving 7 B × every `if (x)` site; (2) `_flags_reflect_rax` tracker skips the `test` entirely when preceding arith already set ZF from rax — another 3 B per site where it fires. cc5 shrinks 526,272 → 504,416 B (−21,856 B / **−4.15 %**). |
| v5.6.9 (O2 redundant push/pop elim) | 355 | −54 ms (−13.2 %) | CP-tracking peephole: `EPUSHR`/`ESPILL` record `_last_push_cp = GCP(S)` after emitting the push; `EPOPR`/`EUNSPILL` check `GCP(S) == _last_push_cp` and rewind CP past the push (x86 −1 B; aarch64 −4 B) if nothing was emitted between the two. Most of the 381 adjacent `50 58` pairs in v5.6.8 came from v5.6.7's strength-reduction helper (`ESPILL; EUNSPILL` around single-identifier LHS subtrees). Wall-clock within noise; **cc5 shrinks 504,416 → 504,000 B (−416 B / −0.082 %)**; 381 `50 58` pairs → 0. aarch64 mirror: `advanced.tcyr` −488 B, `args.tcyr` −328 B. |
| v5.6.10 (O2 commutative combine-shuttle elim) | 360 | −49 ms (−12.0 %) | Scope retargeted from roadmap: `mov + add + add imm → lea` found 0 matches in cc5. The SAME combine path emits a 7-byte shuttle after binary ops: `mov rcx,rax; pop rax; op rax,rcx`. For commutative ops (ADD/AND/OR/XOR/IMUL) replacing with `pop rcx; op rax,rcx` (4 B) saves 3 B per site. Two trackers (`_last_emovca_cp`, `_last_movca_popr_cp`) + `_TRY_COMBINE_SHUTTLE` helper in x86 emit helpers. Wall-clock within noise; **cc5 shrinks 504,000 → 487,040 B (−16,960 B / −3.37 %)** — second-largest single-patch win of v5.6.x. 5861 shuttle sites → 0. Non-commutative SUB/CMP (+ the literal LEA combining originally scheduled) pinned for a later LEA-spirit patch. |
| v5.6.11 (O2 aarch64 combine-shuttle elim) | 347 | −62 ms (−15.2 %) | **x86 codegen unchanged** — this patch modifies only the aarch64 backend. Self-host timing on x86 is within noise of v5.6.10 (360 → 347 ms moves inside the ±5 ms envelope; no regression). **The real win is on the aarch64 target binary**: native aarch64 cc5 (cross-compiled) shrinks 471,360 → 453,688 B (**−17,672 B / −3.75 %**). Scope retargeted from original roadmap (`mul+add → madd` / `and+lsr → ubfx` / signed `sbfx` / `msub`) — bytescan found 0 matches for all four patterns because cyrius's combine codegen always shuttles intermediate values through the stack. Ported v5.6.10 instead: 4419 commutative shuttle sites (`mov x1,x0; ldr x0,[sp],#16; op x0,x0,x1`, 12 B) → `ldr x1,[sp],#16; op x0,x0,x1` (8 B). Trackers wired on both backends now; helper `_TRY_COMBINE_SHUTTLE` mirrored. Originally-planned fused ops re-pinned to v5.6.14, post-regalloc. **Closes Phase O2.** |

### v5.6.5 finding vs v5.6.4 prediction

The v5.6.5 roadmap entry predicted "10–25 % compile-throughput" from
the FNV-1a hash. Observed: 1.7 %. Actual FINDFN is not the hot path —
the compiler's ~500 fn-count stays in a regime where linear scan +
early-exit STREQ on mismatched prefixes is already fast enough that
the hash lookup's FNV-1a loop + probe comparison doesn't dominate.

Implication for v5.6.6 peephole work: the parse / emit / fixup
phases must be the real time sinks. Per-phase instrumentation (which
v5.6.5 intentionally scoped to just total compile time) is a natural
v5.6.6 refinement if we need to pick between peephole candidates.

The FNV-1a delta IS real and byte-identical-self-host-safe, so v5.6.5
ships it. The 1.7 % number just sets expectations: optimization
predictions are upper bounds, and the O-arc total (10–60 % expected
per roadmap §v5.6.x) should be re-verified patch-by-patch rather
than assumed.

## v5.6.x series — regression.tcyr

Smaller workload (~200 LOC, ~40 fns in scope) for sensitivity check.

| Release | Median (ms) | Δ vs v5.6.4 | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| v5.6.4 (pre-O1 baseline) | 53 | — | Dominated by stdlib-include expansion, not compile-core. |
| v5.6.5 (O1: FNV-1a FINDFN) | 51 | −2 ms (−3.8 %) | Slightly better relative scaling — smaller fn count means FINDFN weight is proportionally larger. |

## v5.6.x series — output-byte count on cc5 itself

When a peephole shrinks generated code, the cc5 binary (which is
generated by cyrius compiling its own source) shrinks too. This is
a more stable signal than compile wall-clock.

| Release | cc5 size (B) | Δ vs v5.6.4 | Note |
|---------|--------------|-------------|------|
| v5.6.4 | 525,344 | — | Pre-O1 baseline. |
| v5.6.5 | 526,888 | +1,544 | FNV-1a code added, no generated-output change. |
| v5.6.6 | 528,144 | +2,800 | PE GetTickCount64 + Mach-O __got growth code. |
| v5.6.7 | 526,272 | +928 | Peephole CODE adds ~660 B, but peephole APPLIED to cc5's own compilation saves ~2,540 B, net −1,872 B vs v5.6.6. |
| v5.6.8 | 504,416 | −20,928 | Flag-reuse + `test rax, rax` replaces `push/xor/movca/pop/cmp` dance. New peephole CODE adds ~430 B but saves ~22,280 B when applied to cc5 compiling itself. **Biggest single-patch shrinkage** of v5.6.x so far. |
| v5.6.9 | 504,000 | −21,344 | Redundant push/pop elim. New peephole CODE adds ~346 B but cancels 381 adjacent `push rax; pop rax` pairs in cc5 (762 B), net −416 B. Smaller per-site win than v5.6.8 (2 B vs 7 B), but similar hot-helper targeting: the dance was generated by v5.6.7's strength-reduction helper spilling across single-identifier LHS subtrees where nothing needed preserving. |
| v5.6.10 | 487,040 | −38,304 | Commutative combine-shuttle elim. Replaces `mov rcx,rax; pop rax; op rax,rcx` (7 B) with `pop rcx; op rax,rcx` (4 B) for ADD/AND/OR/XOR/IMUL. 5861 sites (5399 ADD + 340 AND + 66 OR + 3 XOR + 53 IMUL); 17,583 B raw savings minus ~623 B new peephole code = −16,960 B net. Second-largest single-patch shrinkage of v5.6.x (v5.6.8's flag-reuse remains #1 at −21,856 B). Scope retargeted from the originally-slotted LEA combining, which found 0 matches in cc5 output — the real shuttle cost was hiding under what v5.6.8's lesson predicted: hot helpers. |
| v5.6.11 | 487,040 | −38,304 | **x86 cc5 unchanged** — this patch touches only the aarch64 backend. The shrinkage is on the aarch64 target binary: native aarch64 cc5 produced by the cross-compiler drops 471,360 → 453,688 B (**−17,672 B / −3.75 %**). Same shape as v5.6.10: 4419 commutative shuttle sites (`mov x1,x0; ldr x0,[sp],#16; op x0,x0,x1`, 12 B) collapsed to `ldr x1,[sp],#16; op x0,x0,x1` (8 B) — 4 B saved per site. ADD 4021, AND 266, ORR 95, MUL 35, EOR 2 → 0 each. Non-commutative SUB (268 sites) intentionally skipped. v5.6.10's CHANGELOG claim that aarch64 "has no accumulator-shuttle counterpart" was wrong — `parse.cyr`'s combine codegen is shared across backends. Originally-planned aarch64 fused ops (`madd`/`msub`/`ubfx`/`sbfx`) re-pinned to v5.6.18, post-regalloc. **Closes Phase O2.** |
| v5.6.12 | 488,088 | −37,256 | **Phase O3a — IR-instrument parse emits.** 15 `_IR_REC0(S, IR_RAW_EMIT)` markers across parse.cyr / parse_decl.cyr / parse_expr.cyr / parse_fn.cyr covering every direct-emit block (switch jump-table, inline asm, sub-byte field load, `&fn`/`&local`/closure addresses, f64 compare, 7 x87 intrinsics, struct-return rep-movsb, regalloc spill+restore). New IR_RAW_EMIT opcode in ir.cyr. **Instrumentation cost: +1,048 B** call overhead with default `IR_ENABLED=0`. LASE/DBE enable attempt surfaced a **pre-existing correctness bug** — 811 candidates / 5,692 B "savings" actually corrupt cc5 into a parse-error state on trivial input. Rolled LASE/DBE back to disabled; fix pinned to v5.6.14. The instrumentation IS the load-bearing deliverable: future O3 passes can rely on parse-emit IR coverage. |
| v5.6.13 | 488,088 | −37,256 | **`lib/sha1.cyr` extraction — quick-win release.** Stdlib-only addition; zero compiler change. Cc5 unchanged at 488,088 B (except the embedded `5.6.12` → `5.6.13` version string). `_wss_sha1` from `lib/ws_server.cyr` promoted to first-class `lib/sha1.cyr` with public `fn sha1(data, len, digest_out)` API and a prominent "NOT a trust primitive" module header. `lib/ws_server.cyr` delegates via 3-line wrapper (shrinks 420 → 313 lines). 7 FIPS 180-4 / real-world test vectors in `tests/tcyr/sha1.tcyr` all PASS. Unblocks owl / majra / sit. Pulled forward from v5.6.21 at user request as confidence-build between v5.6.12 LASE-bug discovery and v5.6.14 LASE correctness audit. |
| v5.6.14 | 488,776 | −36,568 | **Phase O3a-fix — LASE correctness.** The v5.6.12 LASE-breaks-cc5 bug fixed. Root cause: `parse_ctrl.cyr`'s while/for/for-in/classic-for all captured `loop_top = GCP(S)` without recording an IR_NOP landing pad, so `ir_build_bbs` didn't split at loop tops. `JMP_BACK` edges landed mid-BB, letting LASE eliminate LOAD_LOCALs that only ran on first-entry. Fix: 4 new `ir_emit(S, IR_NOP, 0, loop_top, 0)` calls in parse_ctrl.cyr (mirrors EPATCH's forward-jump convention). Bonus: closed three IR coverage gaps — EMULH (mulh64), EIDIV (/ and %), ELODC (mov rax,[rcx]) now record new `IR_RAX_CLOBBER` opcode. LASE eliminations: 811 → **564** (247 false positives removed); NOP-fills: 5,692 → 3,963 B. cc5 gained 688 B from the new opcode emits (+0.14 %, all conditional on IR_ENABLED ≥ 1). LASE-applied cc5 now correctly compiles + runs. **DBE remains disabled** (suspect #3 deferred to its own slot). |
| v5.6.15 | 488,776 | −36,568 | **IR-emit-order audit — narrow correctness fix.** Recon for v5.6.15's originally-planned const-fold + liveness + DCE work surfaced a pre-existing IR-order vs byte-order inversion in `ESETCC` (`src/backend/x86/emit.cyr`). The helper recorded `_IR_REC1(S, IR_SETCC, op)` **before** calling `ECMPR(S)` (which records IR_CMP). Concrete IR stream said `SETCC → CMP`, byte stream emitted `cmp → setcc`. Any IR-driven pass walking adjacent ops (peephole match, liveness) would see the wrong order. 5-LOC fix moves the IR_REC1 call after ECMPR. IR adjacency before fix: `SETCC → CMP` 3,665, `CMP → SETCC` 0; after fix: `SETCC → CMP` 0, `CMP → SETCC` 3,665. Output bytes unaffected at IR_ENABLED=0 (cc5 byte-identical at 488,776 B). Original v5.6.15 (const-fold + liveness + DCE) cascaded to v5.6.16; everything +1 through v5.6.29 closeout. Audit lesson: emit fns that call other emit fns must record IR **after** the sub-call, not before. |
| v5.6.20 | 520,456 | −4,888 | **Phase O4b — Poletto-Sarkar linear-scan picker (replaces v4.8.4 greedy use-count picker).** Build interval list, insertion-sort by `first_cp` (tie-break by lidx for determinism), walk forward, expire active intervals whose `last < cur.first`, assign free reg or spill furthest-next-use. Time-sliced patch pass rewrites disp32 matches ONLY within `[first, last]` per assigned interval — non-overlapping intervals can share a register cleanly. Time-sliced safety: cyrius `var x = expr;` requires every interval to start with a STORE (no LOAD-from-stack needed at interval start). Verified on 8-hot-local spill-pressure test (5 assigned, 3 spilled, ret=204 matches hand-computed). **Observable change on cc5 self-build = none** — zero `#regalloc` directives in cyrius source; picker only fires opt-in. Infrastructure proven correct; v5.6.21 auto-enable surfaces actual win. cc5 grew +11,576 B for picker algorithm + sort + active-set + bisection knob (`CYRIUS_REGALLOC_PICKER_CAP=N`). Both fixpoints clean (IR=0 b==c, IR=3 b==c at 520,456 B). Patra dep bumped 1.5.5 → 1.6.0 (blob support for `sit`). |
| v5.6.19 | 508,880 | −16,464 | **Phase O4a — per-fn live-interval infrastructure (foundation for v5.6.20 Poletto-Sarkar picker).** First of three Phase O4 sub-slots; original ~600-900 LOC roadmap entry split after structural reality (no vreg layer, no cross-BB liveness) made one-slot infeasible. Extended existing v4.8.4 `#regalloc` peephole's codebuf scan to also build per-local `ra_first[2048]` + `ra_last[2048]` interval tables alongside `ra_counts[2048]`. Fixed pre-existing latent sizing bug — v4.8.4 declared arrays 256 BYTES but loops wrote 256 i64 slots = 2048 bytes; overflow tolerated by use-count picker (high-idx counts default to 0) but interval tracking can't tolerate stale per-slot values. `CYRIUS_REGALLOC_DUMP=1` env knob prints per-fn intervals for inspection. **No codegen change** — picker still greedy use-count; Poletto-Sarkar swap pinned v5.6.20. cc5 grew +7,264 B for the two new arrays + dump path + properly-sized ra_counts. Both fixpoints clean (IR=0 b==c, IR=3 b==c at 508,880 B). Slot count grew 30 → 32 (Phase O4 = v5.6.19/20/21; closeout cascaded v5.6.30 → v5.6.32). |
| v5.6.18 | 501,616 | −23,728 | **Phase O3c — dead-store elimination + fixed-point driver (copy-prop deferred to v5.6.19).** Originally bundled with copy-prop (~330 LOC); shipped as DSE + fixpoint alone (~100 LOC) after recon found copy-prop yields zero direct savings on cyrius's stack-machine IR (LOAD-for-LOAD rewrite is byte-equal). DSE per-BB forward sweep: for each `STORE_LOCAL(x)`, scan forward; if another `STORE_LOCAL(x)` precedes any `LOAD_LOCAL(x)` or opaque op (CALL/SYSCALL/RAW_EMIT/&local), the first is dead. Recon predicted **15 candidates**; measurement matched exactly — **15 DSE kills** at IR=3. Fixed-point driver loops fold → DCE → DSE until no candidates fire (3 iterations on cc5 self-compile). Cascade observed: const-fold count grew 132 → 135 as DCE+DSE removed wrapping ops, exposing new fold patterns. Combined v5.6.18 IR=3 totals: 135 folds + 678 DCE + 15 DSE = **828 candidates / 6,099 B NOP-fill**. cc5 grew +2,896 B for `ir_dead_store` + `CYRIUS_DSE_CAP` debug knob + fixpoint loop. Both fixpoints clean (IR=0 b==c, IR=3 b==c at 501,616 B). Compaction (real binary shrinkage) re-pinned from v5.6.22 to v5.6.23. |
| v5.6.17 | 498,720 | −26,624 | **Phase O3b-fix — bitmap liveness + DCE.** Ships the v5.6.16-deferred half alone after a bisection-driven bug fix; copy-prop + dead-store + fixed-point driver cascaded to v5.6.18. Per-BB backward sweep with u64 liveness bitmap (bit 0 = RAX, bit 1 = RCX). Bug found via `CYRIUS_DCE_CAP=N` bisection (cap=2 OK, cap=3 broke) + per-kill IR context dump: `IR_RAX_CLOBBER` (recorded by EMULH/EIDIV/ELODC) reads RCX as operand/divisor/address, but v5.6.16 had it in `_ir_def_rcx_any` (treating it as a writer). Same misclassification for `IR_ADD_IMM_X1` (rcx += imm reads rcx) and `IR_RAW_EMIT` (opaque conservative reader). Three-line fix in `src/common/ir.cyr`. **678 DCE kills, 2,010 B NOP-fill** at IR=3; combined with v5.6.16's const-fold: 132 folds + 678 DCE = 810 candidates / 2,794 B total NOP-fill. Both fixpoints clean (IR=0 b==c, IR=3 b==c at 498,720 B). cc5 grew +1,024 B for DCE wiring + `CYRIUS_DCE_CAP` debug knob. Bisection methodology (cap env + dump) saved as a debug knob — generalizes to copy-prop and future IR passes. Compaction (real binary shrinkage) still pinned v5.6.22. |
| v5.6.16 | 497,696 | −27,648 | **Phase O3b part 1/2 — IR const-fold (DCE deferred).** Forward state-machine sweep over IR detects `LOAD_IMM(a), PUSH, LOAD_IMM(b), [POP_RCX | MOV_CA + POP_RAX], OP` patterns the parse-time `_cfo` fold missed. Two shapes: v5.6.10-shuttle-elim commutative path (`POP_RCX, OP`) and non-commutative (`MOV_CA, POP_RAX, OP`). For each match: compute `fold_val = a OP b`, in-place rewrite codebuf — write `EMOVI(fold_val)` bytes at LHS LOAD_IMM CP, NOP-fill remainder. Foldable ops: ADD/SUB/MUL/AND/OR/XOR/SHL/SHR (DIV/MOD skipped — divide-by-zero would need panic mid-fold). Recon predicted **128 candidates** (109 SUB + 18 SHL + 1 AND); measurement: **130 folds, 774 B NOP-fill** at IR=3 on cc5 self-compile. Both fixpoints clean (IR=0 b==c, IR=3 b==c at 497,696 B). cc5 grew +8,920 B for const-fold helpers + the deferred-but-shipped `ir_dce` skeleton. Compile time unchanged at IR=0 (~347 ms median). **DCE deferred to v5.6.17** — two correctness attempts (738 → 1,674 wrongly-killed nodes) corrupted cc5 even after expanding `_ir_uses_rax` with SYSCALL/CALL/TAIL_JMP/RET/EPILOGUE/RAW_EMIT/RAX_CLOBBER. Per "quality before ops" + roadmap "STOP and ask" rules. **v5.6.21 re-pinned** to codebuf compaction (NOP harvest with jump+fixup repair) — sweeps all per-pass NOP overhead in one pass for real binary shrinkage. NOP-fill in v5.6.16 preserves byte positions to keep jumps/fixups valid; shrinkage waits on v5.6.21. |

The v5.6.8 delta is an order of magnitude larger than v5.6.7
because `ECONDCMP` is a hot helper — every `if (x)`, `while (x)`,
`for (; x; ...)`, etc. condition without an explicit comparator
ran through the 10-byte dance. Shrinking that dance to 3 B (or
0 B with flag reuse) cascades across thousands of sites in cc5's
own source.

The v5.6.5 prediction of "10–25 % compile-throughput" has now
partially materialized — v5.6.8 alone delivered −13.2 % compile
time (which also scales the output-bytes win). v5.6.9 (push/pop
cancel) and v5.6.10 (commutative combine-shuttle elim; retargeted
from the originally-slotted literal LEA combining after a bytescan
found 0 matches) shipped against the 504 KB / 355 ms baseline.
v5.6.11 **closed Phase O2** with a retargeted aarch64 backport of
v5.6.10 (4419 shuttle sites on aarch64, −17,672 B on the target
binary) — x86 self-host timing unchanged since the patch didn't
touch x86 codegen. Originally-planned aarch64 fused ops re-pinned
to v5.6.14, post-regalloc.

## 3-step fixpoint verification (new in v5.6.7)

Starting with v5.6.7 (the first patch that modifies generated
bytes), the standard "build cc5; rebuild with cc5; compare" check
doesn't hold across the compiler-upgrade step. The correct pattern
is:

```sh
cat src/main.cyr | build/cc5 > /tmp/cc5_a; chmod +x /tmp/cc5_a
cat src/main.cyr | /tmp/cc5_a > /tmp/cc5_b;  chmod +x /tmp/cc5_b
cat src/main.cyr | /tmp/cc5_b > /tmp/cc5_c
cmp /tmp/cc5_b /tmp/cc5_c   # MUST be byte-identical
```

Steps a→b introduce the optimization; steps b→c are the fixpoint
check. All subsequent O-arc patches should follow this shape.

## Methodology / tooling

### `CYRIUS_PROF=1` environment flag

v5.6.5 adds `CYRIUS_PROF=1` as an opt-in runtime flag. When set,
cc5 records `clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC)` at entry (after env
predefines land, before `PREPROCESS`) and again just before
`syscall(SYS_EXIT, 0)`, printing `prof: compile <ms> ms` to stderr.

Usage:

```sh
CYRIUS_PROF=1 build/cc5 < src/main.cyr > /tmp/cc5_out 2> /tmp/cc5.prof
cat /tmp/cc5.prof
# → prof: compile 400 ms
```

Costs when CYRIUS_PROF is unset: one env-var lookup (3 syscalls
against /proc/self/environ, already in init path for other envs) +
a single `load8` comparison. ~µs, unmeasurable in compile-time deltas.

Costs when CYRIUS_PROF=1: add two `clock_gettime` calls (~100 ns
each) + a handful of `syscall(SYS_WRITE)` calls at exit. Also <1 ms.

### Per-phase breakdown — deferred

v5.6.5 reports total compile time only. Per-phase counters (lex /
preprocess / parse / emit / fixup) are a natural extension if a
specific optimization patch needs to choose between candidates by
measured phase weight. Not speculatively added — no current patch
demands it.

### Cross-compiler profiling

`cc5_aarch64` uses syscall 113 (aarch64 Linux generic table number for
`clock_gettime`); x86 uses 228. Windows PE and macOS Mach-O cross
outputs fall through to `return 0` in `_prof_clock_ns` since those
syscall numbers mean something different on those OSes. Profiling
data on PE / Mach-O is not meaningful for v5.6.5 (prints `0 ms`);
shell-level timing (`time cc5_win.exe < ...`) is the recommendation
for those targets until per-target clock wrappers land.

## Notes for v5.6.6 (peephole) and later

- **Don't re-predict 10–25 %** without evidence. The v5.6.5 result
  shows backend-phase cost dominates, not FINDFN. Peephole wins
  should fall on emit-phase bytes, and the measurement should be
  byte-count of generated code rather than (or in addition to)
  compile wall-clock.
- **Add per-phase counters when they pay off.** If v5.6.6's
  strength-reduction / flag-reuse / move-elim produce outputs whose
  size delta is visible but compile-time delta is noisy, split the
  prof dump into `lex / parse / emit / fixup` segments at that point
  and re-measure.
- **Don't measure on a busy host.** Variance between runs is 2–3 %
  even on an idle machine; median-of-5 is the floor for reporting.
